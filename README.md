## Hello, my name is Tom Johnson

I am a developer who enjoys building systems and tools that make a big impact on overall efficiency. I enjoy collaborating with designers and building their visions, with the user at the heart of everything I do. I have experience in the Shopify field and am currently upskilling myself through roadmap.sh. You can find some of those projects on [here](https://roadmap.sh/u/vxlzz).
